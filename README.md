 ðŸ”­ I am looking for a position as a junior software developer. I have completed a 16-week intensive coding bootcamp with HyperionDev in the hopes of securing a full-time Python software development role. It is a fast-paced course, both challenging and exciting for me to learn and apply new techniques to problems. I look forward to starting my professional coding career and applying the skills I have learned to real-world problems and tasks. In particular, my Python and SQL database knowledge would help me in those tasks.

ðŸŒ± Some of the skills I am learning in the boot camp are:
- Software development in Python
- SQL Database
- Object-oriented programming
- Using data science libraries to develop data-driven web applications
- Natural language processing
- Systems analysis
- Systems Design
- Management of the software development life cycle
- Static and dynamic web development
- Source version control
- Backend web development

âš¡I have come from working in the front of house and security sector, working in fast paced and ever changing situations. I have a great thirst for knowledge and often find myself desire for more when working. I would love to apply my problem solving and quick thinking to the world of computer science. I believe my strong communication and team working skills will be a great asset to the company and team that I work in.
